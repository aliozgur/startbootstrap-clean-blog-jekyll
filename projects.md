This page is intended to provide some background and details for couple of projects I was involved with during my professional career. I think these projects, among many others, helped me shape my software development skills. 

If you want to see all the projects I was involved with [please visit my LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/aliozgur)

## PragmaSQL
PragmaSQL is a T-SQL editor which I've started developing during summer of 2005 (The name was actually InfoSQL). The initial version was developed with Delphi 6 and was used extensively by Bilgi University's Software Development team. The team provided lots of feedback and at some point, I guess that was in 2007, I decided to port PragmaSQL to .NET with C#. I love Delphi very much and I still have some apps used in production (yes I know we are in 2015) and from time to time I still provide support to those apps. But in 2007 or some time around these years Borland was losing developer attraction which made .NET and C# a good alternative.

During 2007 I've completed porting Delphi 6 code to  C#. Then I published PragmaSQL as a commercial product. And that was an important point in my career, because I started to run my own small business. During this period I had the chance to practice running a commercial product. Some notable things of that period are

* I've created a web site dedicated to PragmaSQL
* I've used Cuyahoga CMS, one of the first .NET based open source CMS implementations, to host the PragmaSQL site
* I've developed some plugins for Cuyahoga, which introduced me to the open source .NET community
* I've published couple of articles on CodeProject related to Cuyahoga plugins I've developed
* I've created my own license validation component which was talking to PragmaSQL web site over web services 
* PragmaSQL got The Code Project's Members Choice Award in General Database Tools category in 2009 and 2010

After maintaining PragmaSQL as a commercial product for two years I've open sourced the code at the beginning of 2011 on Codeplex. PragmaSQL is now at version 3 and is still [open source](https://github.com/aliozgur/pragmasql) and maintained.You can visit PragmaSQL [Web Site](http://www.pragmasql.com/pragmasql/default.aspx) or  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aliozgur/pragmasql) if you want to see more details or some code.

>Bilgi University Software Development Team still uses PragmaSQL as the main T-SQL editor which provides object history tracking besides other great features.

## eXpressOto 
eXpressOto is a vehicle repair services and management application developed for [İSBAK](http://www.isbak.com.tr/en) which is a public company partially owned by İstanbul Municipality. 

eXpressOto was the first application I've developed with Microsoft Entity Framework as Object Relational Mapper. The ORM things was not new to me since I've developed number of line of business web applications with NHibernate (starting from version 0.5 as far as I can remember), LLBLGen Pro and SubSonic. But with eXpressOto I had the chance to explore all those great things offered by EF (I admit EF was hard than enough to work with at that time).

>eXpressOto is still in active use and runs the whole repair services process that result in multi million dollar transactions annually.

**Tools and Technologies**

* Microsoft SQL Server
* .NET and C#
* WinForms
* Entity Framework 4
* Reflection## JiraTouch

## SUGES
SUGES is a DCU and RTU data collection and control system. Me and my team at PragmaTouch  developed SUGES for a local natural gas and electricity distribution company. The main purpose of the system is to collect data from DCU and RTU devices and manage the devices installed on the field. 

The technologies used are C#, ASP.NET MVC, ServiceStack, Quartz.NET and Redis.
